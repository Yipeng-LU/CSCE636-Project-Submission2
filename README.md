# CSCE636-Project-Submission2
To run the prediction function:

1. Open colab in GPU mode
2. Copy everything in Install_Openpose and run in colab
3. Copy everything in 'Prediction Function' and run in colab
4. Upload the video onto colab root directory('/content/')
5. Upload the model onto colab root directory: my_model7.h5 (I have shared the model with Prof. Jiang because it is too large)
6. Call the function in colab: predAndPlot(root), where the variable root is root of the video.
